# Coding Sites Repository

## Overview

This repository, `coding_sites`, consolidates code and projects from various coding platforms and educational resources into a single organized place. It encompasses solutions and projects from competitive programming sites, online courses, and capture the flag (CTF) challenges.

## Contents

- **Code Competitions**: Contains solutions and projects developed on platforms like Codewars and HackerRank.
- **Code Academy**: Includes all the exercises and projects done through the Codecademy platform.
- **CTF**: Stores code for various CTF challenges, including OverTheWire (OTW), picoCTF, and OTW's Advent CTF 2019.
- **Udemy**: Comprises code snippets and project files from different Udemy courses, covering a range of programming topics and technologies.

## Purpose

The purpose of consolidating these resources into one repository is to streamline the management and access of code developed across different platforms, making it easier to reference and build upon past projects.

## Structure

Each former repository now exists as a directory within `coding_sites`, organized by the source platform:

- `/code_competitions`

  - `/hackerrank`
- `/code_academy`
- `/ctf`
  - `/otw`
  - `/picoCTF`
